# RC-Matchmaker 

## (In progress) - Web app to efficiently match Recursers with pairing partners



At the Recurse Center pair programming is encouraged as a way to learn from others and grow as a programmer. Unfortunately, the most common regret that recursers have after completing their batch is that they didn't pair as much as they would have liked. This app is designed to help people who are willing to pair find each other, and to decrease some of the social bariers to pairing.
